= About Me

#set text(size: 10pt, fill: rgb("#334155"))
I am a Computer Engineer and Business Administration graduate. I currently work as a full-stack developer in the renewable energy sector, building everything from interfaces on embedded Linux systems to internal web applications from scratch. My dual background gives me a different perspective: I don't just focus on how to build software, but on understanding why it's worth building in the first place.


#set text(size: 10pt, fill: rgb("#334155"))
I'm passionate about high-impact projects, space exploration, and automation. I integrate AI daily to work smarter, but I actively study and improve my programming skills, as I don't believe we are anywhere near being replaced by it yet. My goal is to surround myself with brilliant people to solve hard problems, and I am completely open to relocating anywhere in Europe or the US (having already lived in Belgium and Lithuania) to join a project that matters.

Software development for the renewable energy sector: HMI interfaces for high-power solar inverters on embedded Linux platforms (SoM), and internal web applications for company process digitalization. I work with Python, Vue, Astro, Flask, SQL, Docker, and industrial protocols (Modbus, CAN, SCADA).
#list(
  [Designed and built from scratch an internal web app (Astro + PostgreSQL + Vue) for inventory management and lab scheduling that significantly improved team productivity],
  [Built REST APIs with Flask under external client requirements with extensive behavior specification lists],
  [Designed an automated internationalization (i18n) pipeline to manage translations seamlessly],
  [Managed the full lifecycle: from requirements to deployment with Docker on self-hosted servers and SoMs]
